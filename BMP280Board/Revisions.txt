PCB ordered 8th Dec 2023
  Pads for resistors and capacitors were wrongly specified as "0201_0603Metric", when they should have been "0603_1608Metric_Pad0.98x0.95mm_HandSolder"
    ( the footprint had "0603" in the title, which is what I was looking for. I hadn't realized that the first number is inch, the second is mm )
  I had wrongly connected A4 ( SDA ) on Nano to SDO on BMP280. It should have been connected to SDI on BMP280.
  Likewise SDI was wrongly connected to a pull down to GND, but it should have been SDO getting pulled down to GND.
  I had connected a capacitor between A4 on Nano and GND, but it should have been connected between V3.3 and GND somewhere near the BMP280.
  I'd like to convert the footpring for the BMP280 to a hand solder footpring.
