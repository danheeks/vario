paragliding vario with arduino nano, piezo sounder, bmp180 altimeter, 4x Nimh batteries

I made one using the MS5611 module, which is more expensive, but I read that it is less affected by RF noise.

I made one with BMP180 with ideas from here

putting it in a metal tin seems to cut out the RF interference.  
  
I made one with BMP280. 
This works so well that I can leave the sensor to do the averaging and let the arduino sleep in between.<br />
The reponse time is quicker than the one with the BMP180.

One battery lasted me two summers of amateur paragliding including a flight of 202km in the UK!
