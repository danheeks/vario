paragliding vario with arduino nano, piezo sounder, bmp180 altimeter, 4x Nimh batteries

I made one using the MS5611 module, which is more expensive, but I read that it is less affected by RF noise.

I made one with BMP180 with ideas from here

putting it in a metal tin seems to cut out the RF interference.  
  
I made one with BMP280. This works so well that I can leave the sensor to do the averaging and let the arduino sleep in between.  
The reponse time is quicker than the one with the BMP180.

One battery lasted me two summers of amateur paragliding including a flight of 202km in the UK!
