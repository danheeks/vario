Wiring :

six pins on vario ( with pins in top right corner of board )

1 MISO  -   VCC 2
3 SCK   -  MOSI 4
5 RESET -   GND 6


Uno to Vario
10 (SS) 1 (RESET)
11 (MOSI) 17 (MOSI)
12 (MISO) 18 (MISO)
13 (SCK) 19 (SCK)
3.3V 20 (VACC) and 7 (VCC)
GND 22 (GND)



I was using Arduino IDE 2.1.0

Add http://drazzy.com/package_drazzy.com_index.json to 
File->Preferences->Additional boards manager URL
( add a comma if something already there )

Select "ATTinyCore by Spence Konde" and click "Install"

Load ArduinoISP sketch from Files->examples->ArduinoISP ( upload onto Uno )



    Select Tools->Board->Attiny48/88. After this, the "Tools" menus should show the following for the board. Make clock, "B.O.D." and other selections as appropriate:

Board: "ATtiny48/88"
Chip: ATtiny88
Clock: "8MHz (internal)"
Save EEPRO: "EEPROM retained"
LTO: "Disabled"
B.O.D. Level: "B.O.D. Disabled"

    Select Tools->Programmer->"Arduino as ISP". The "Tools" menu should then show the following:

Programmer: "Arduino as ISP"

    Now upload your sketch for ATT88 as usual.
